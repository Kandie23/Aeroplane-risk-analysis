# Aircraft Investment Risk 
### Overview
This project uses Python, Pandas, and Tableau to analyze historical aircraft accident and incident data. The goal is to identify safer aircraft models and manufacturers to support data-driven investment decisions.

### Objectives
1. To identify aircraft makes and models with the lowest accident and incident rates.
2. To analyze accident severity and understand potential repair and replacement costs.
3. To evaluate manufacturer risk profiles for safer investment.
4. To provide actionable recommendations to reduce operational risk and maximize ROI.

### Business Understanding
Stakeholder: Airline executives, fleet managers, and investors.

Key Business Questions:

1. Which aircraft makes and models have the lowest historical accident rates?

2. What patterns exist in accident severity that could affect maintenance and insurance costs?

3. Which manufacturers consistently show higher risk and should be avoided?

### Data Understanding and Analysis
Source of Data: Kaggle

Historical aircraft accident and incident records, including variables like Make, Model, Damage Level, Fatality Rate, and Weather Conditions.



### Columns include:

- Make, Model, Aircraft Category, Engine Type, Number of Engines, Aircraft Damage, Injury Severity, Total Fatalities, Serious Injuries, Minor Injuries, Total Occupants
- Fatality Rate, High Risk Flag, Weather Condition.

### Visualizations
1️. Accident Severity Distribution

Shows that substantial damage is the most common accident outcome, not total destruction.

2️. Top 10 Riskiest Manufacturers

Identifies Cessna 172S, 172R, and 170B as the safest investment options based on the lowest incident counts.

### Conclusion
- Cessna 172S, 172R, and 170B show the lowest accident and incident rates in the dataset, making them strong candidates for investment.

- Substantial damage is the most common outcome, suggesting that incidents are often repairable, which has implications for cost and downtime.

- The top 10 riskiest manufacturers were identified, giving stakeholders clear guidance on which aircraft types to avoid or monitor closely.
